# Brainstorming Memory Game - Planning and Design

## Concept:
The Brainstorming Memory Game is a classic memory matching game with a twist. Instead of matching pairs of identical cards, players must match cards with related concepts, encouraging creativity and brainstorming.

## Features:
1. Game Board: A grid of cards that the player can flip to reveal hidden symbols.
2. Card Deck: A deck of cards containing pairs of related concepts (e.g., "Coffee" and "Mug").
3. Gameplay Mechanics:
   - Players flip two cards per turn to reveal their symbols.
   - If the symbols match, the cards stay flipped. Otherwise, they are flipped back.
   - The game ends when all pairs have been matched.
4. Scoring: Keep track of the number of moves taken to complete the game.
5. Timer: Track the time taken to complete the game.
6. Restart Button: Allow players to reset the game and start over.

## Visual Design:
- The game board will be displayed in a grid layout, with cards evenly distributed.
- Each card will have a backside and a front side displaying the hidden symbol.
- The game interface will include a scoreboard, timer, and restart button.
- Use a minimalist design with clean typography and subtle animations to enhance user experience.
- Consider using thematic graphics or illustrations to reinforce the brainstorming theme.

## Interaction Design:
- Clicking on a card flips it to reveal its symbol.
- Players can only flip two cards at a time.
- Provide visual feedback for matched pairs and unmatched cards.
- Display messages to inform the player of their progress (e.g., "Match found!" or "Try again!").
- Make game controls intuitive and easily accessible on both desktop and mobile devices.

## Technical Considerations:
- Implement game logic using JavaScript for interactivity and functionality.
- Use HTML and CSS for structuring the game interface and styling its elements.
- Ensure cross-browser compatibility and responsiveness for a seamless experience across different devices.
- Optimize assets and code for performance and loading times.
